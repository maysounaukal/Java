Elliot:

Are you a one or a zero? That's the question you have to ask yourself.
Are you a yes or a no? Are you going to act or not?

Mr. Robot:

Yo... you've been staring at a computer screen way too long, homie.
Life's not that binary. Isn't it?

Elliot:

Sure, there are grays... But when you come right down to it, at its core,
beneath every choice, there's either a one or a zero. You either do something or you don't.

You walk out that door, you've decided to do nothing, to say no, which means you do not come back.
You leave, you are no longer a part of this. You become a zero.

If you stay, if you want to change the world, you become a yes. You become a one.

So, I'll ask you again: are you a one or a zero?

Though she's a psychologist she's really bad at reading people but I'm good at reading people.
My secret? I look for the worst in them.

No rest for the wicked.

It's good. So good, it scratched that part of my mind.
The part that doesn't allow good to exist without a condition.
